She barely looked up from her computer when I was trying to tell her my issues. Perhaps this is common practice in India where she got her degree, but her performance with me was more like an inebriated dentist pretending to be a doctor from the 1880’s old west. After a procedure in the hospital from my cardiologist, Dr. Kalani (a good doctor) she visited me as she had to because she was my primary, and was very very rude to me after I complimented on how nice her sweater was. “You do not talk to me in that fashion.

I had a C-section with my first and he calmed all my nerves before hand and reassured that I and my son would be perfectly fine, and we were! The surgery was done and over within 20 minutes and I was wheeled into recovery shortly after. He gave me his blessings before he left and told us congratulations. He didn't just deliver the baby and then leave. He made sure we were okay first and went on his way. He made a scary situation easier for me, my husband, and my newborn. I am forever thankful for him and his professionalism, and his staff. I am now pregnant with our second baby and things are going just as great as the first time around.

1002298,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"I came to Dr. Tahernia with a severe case of Hidradenitis Suppurativa in my perianal and groin regions. I was unable to sit down and under immense pain. This did not allow me to work, and my family was seriously affected having to cope with the impotency of not being able to help me at all. Being the sole provider of five, this had become a family emergency since I was about to have to go on permanent disability and end my beloved engineering career. This incurable disease is one of the most challenging skin diseases that a surgeon can encounter. I had learned about Dr. Tahernia's reputation on the web, but after engaging several doctors and having multiple surgeries for many years, I had reasonable doubts. Once I met Dr. Tahernia in Los Angeles, he gave me confidence and courage. He was honest with me and told me that it would be a long and hard battle in order for me to fully recover, but that he felt good about the outcome. Well he was right. It took 10 surgeries with general anesthesia and almost four weeks in the hospital. Now I am back home in North Carolina recovering and owing my life (literally) to Dr. Tahernia's magic hands that have gave me a new chance to live life to its fullest. My ""incurable"" disease is slowly disappearing and the prognosis is excellent. Dr. Tahernia is a rare find among the jungle of physicians out there. He is always on top of the situation taking carful care of you. I was even able to call or text him on weekends or from the hospital at odd hours, and he would always respond or take immediate action when necessary, even if it meant sacrificing important family time.. I will never forget that, especially when I remember those scary times in the hospital. His staff is also one of a kind ready and willing to act immediately to resolve your problems. HS is curable ! --- Please see Dr. Tahernia if you're serious about getting better. At advanced stages, HS is NOT cured with home remedies, general surgeons, antibiotics, dermatologists or support groups that go nowhere... It requires a decisive and strong knowledgeable hand to conduct a radical removal of the affected area. Thank you Dr. Tahernia for your compassion, knowledge and dedication... You will always be inspiration to me... May God bless you. John N.",5.0

I have been to him twice, once for me, this time for my son. This time I was told if I didn't pay, X amount of dollars (double the normal price up front) then he wouldn't be able to have the surgery. The office girl at the front (Christy) claimed that she got the quote from my insurance, which is a lie and I told that to Christy. They can’t quote without seeing an actual bill and the deductible can change as other billings come in and reduce the amount, but according to Christy the Ofc Mgr wouldn’t budge; I had no choice and I asked for the mgr but In 4 yrs, I have never be able to speak with the office manager. I don't think they had one; Christy lies all the time and I catch her at it. When I confronted Christy later about billing that had been rec’d by the insurance and the actual amount they said I owed (1/2 the amount she demanded initially) she told me to contact their billing in the Midwest. I had to speak with them if I was going to get my refund) and found out later they were in Orange Ca (she said this so she wouldn't have to call the billing to help straighten her mess out). I asked her why she told me they were in the Midwest and I accused her of pushing me off, she said that she assumed they were in the Midwest since the person she always dealt with sent emails at 4am so she must be on Midwest time. Is that nuts? I was so upset I decided to talk with the doctor about it and he told me he doesn’t get involved with the billing or his staff, he is just a surgeon and if I didn’t like it that I could go somewhere else. I was beyond frustrated now and it seemed Christy was doing everything she could to upset me and it didn’t seem like I could do anything about it. Well I really couldn’t just walk out at this point as my son still had stiches (after 2 months) and I just wanted to get through it but I will NEVER go back, it was so not worth it having to deal with Christy. If you ask why I went the 2nd time and didn’t go to another surgeon, is because the type of operation needed to be expediently, there was no time to waste and I knew he is a good surgeon. I figured we had been through this before and they knew I was a good paying customer and that it wouldn’t be a problem. Wow, little did I know. I am sorry to say but a doctor is as good as his staff and if he doesn’t care how his staff operates then he isn’t a good doctor. Final thought, I had told the doctor he had better care because I thought his Office Mgr/Christy were skimming money or cooking the books…he didn’t seem concerned so is he just happy to get extra money from some of his customers? Because like Christy told me, they don’t bill if you don’t owe anything and if you are owed a refund, you have to inquire, they don’t monitor that. Sounds like a fraud to me!",1.0

1002595,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.5,"I previously wrote a positive review of Dr. Chesler, but I am sorry to have to revise it now for the benefit of potential patients. Dr. Chesler seemed to me a knowledgeable physician and a nice person. I had been seeing this doctor for several months. At one point it was discovered that I hadn't met my deductible, and so owed the practice about $150. I arranged with the office to make payments at each visit over and above my copay until the balance was payed off, and have done this. My last visit was on Oct.1, and as usual, I made my payment and there was no communication that there was any problem or that they wished for me to make a larger payment. On Oct. 9, I was shocked to receive a letter from the office saying that I needed to call a number (not the office number) immediately or I would cease to be a patient of Dr. Chesler. The letter said that I was sent a certified letter (which I was) and included was a form to request records to send to my new doctor. Because I thought so highly of Dr. Chesler, I couldn't imagine he would agree to such unprofessional, manipulative, unheard of tactics. If the office was having financial troubles and needed me to make a larger payment, they could have communicated it to me. I believe I acted honorably and decently with this office, and in turn, I didn't receive the same courtesy. I called and left a message of my concerns and did not receive a return call. The next day I did speak to someone in the office, and I thought the doctor had perhaps turned over his accounts to an agency that received a commission, and so would be eager to shake down patients with balances. It took a while to drag out of the staff that the person responsible was Dr. Chesler's wife Jeannie. I was told a number of things by the office, that this person, ""owned the practice,"" and was, ""Dr. Chesler's boss. Okay, so now we have the truth. Although a doctor may remove a patient for any reason if 30 days notice is given, once an agreement and contract is made, a business cannot call in the balance. Since they accepted my payment of $50 on Oct. 1, along with other payments, that constitutes a contract. Please don't tell me you didn't agree to this; if your office did, then you did too. If a business wishes to call in a full balance, then they would be required to refuse any partial payment, which they certainly did not. There was zero communication or warning that I would face this highly upsetting and totally unexpected treatment. Even if a patient hadn't made a payment in a while, this is not the first line of contact. Usually the office will seek to set up a payment plan, which I already had. While speaking to the office, I asked, ""So, am I not going to be able to make my next appointment?"" The answer was, ""Sure you can."" They made an appointment for me. A few hours later I received a message on my machine from Jeannie, the wife, ""Call me right away. This will affect your appointment."" Jeannie, I am not ignorant, nor am I on narcotics as many pain patients are and unable to think clearly and so fall for your scheme. I am surprised that you would go to this much effort since I only owe the office $75. That's right, you forgot to credit my last payment when you decided to enact draconian measures. In my nearly 60 years, I haven't had one medical practice ever do anything like this, even when I owed a significant balance. So, today I came home and discovered another message from Jeannie. She said that my appointment was canceled, since she couldn't get a hold of me. Well, Jeannie, I will save you the need to play your script for me. As much as I like Dr. Chesler, it is not worth it to have to deal with you to see him, and if you treat me like this now, who knows what the future holds? I have 3 pages of doctors with this specialty within 10 miles in my plan search engine. By the way, you need to provide a patient with a 30 day notice, and as I received your communication on 10/9 and today it is 10/21, this is a violation of medical ethics and perhaps more. I think it would have been fair to have received informed consent of ""nice doctor but nasty wife who calls the shots,"" prior to engaging with this practice. It really doesn't make sense to me, as they would lose $150 by canceling my appointment for a $75 balance. I would have sent this communication to the practice, but they have no email. Dr. Chesler did not return my call. No, I don't want to listen to whatever Jeannie has to say, considering how she has treated a good patient despicably. I feel worse for the disabled and narcotic requiring patients who are forced to endure this. Perhaps there is more to the story, as it doesn't add up. Maybe they are selling the practice and want to collect all the balances now, I don't know. I do know I won't receive treatment where there is a breach of trust.",1.0

Stupidly, I put up with her crazy-making behavior; when I changed psychiatrists, my new psychiatrist said that NO doctor should refuse to answer questions and become abusive like that. Check into where she graduated from; in 1969, in the FSU, the schools she went to are highly inferior schools.
